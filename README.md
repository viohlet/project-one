My user story:

How-to-kinda-tic-tac-toe

Planning:

The process started with a wireframe of the game project. The wireframe described simple elements such as the welcome section which included Log-in, Sign-in and Change Password options. Later, it included the board, a few Xs and Os, and my "Goodbye" section with Update Game, New Game, Challenge someone, Find Game, Saved History and Log-out.
Development Process:

Set-up the template
Started with html and css and things were going wonderful. Life was great.
Added some buttons for the welcome and goodbye sections. Perf.
Decided to do my tic-tac-toe with forms: Innovator.
Had the idea to do a tic-tac-toe Prince of Persia (old school) version and added a background picture. Bomb.
Got to my logic and life sucks. I am miserable.
Angel called Christina helped me with my logic and game me tips about being organized with my code.
Gave up in life and got rid of my tic tac toe buttons and experienced the disappointment on myself.
Cleaned up my code! Set up jQuery and Ajax! Too many tabs! Atom and Chrome hate me!
Ajax does not work! -.-
Angel Ben was with me to merge branches because I was to damn scared to do it alone! Can't deal...
Fixed some Ajax issues and was determined to do a POP version.
Worked on styling at night and did a lot of progress.
Had extra time to finish the project and completed the requirements plus added more features to my front-end.
Problem-Solving Strategies:

Adding a locally sourced image to my site: I was ok with the url but quickly remember how we are not supposed to do that, and so turns out "url(prince.jpg)" works as long as the image is in your styling folder.
My buttons did not work, and never worked. I would very much like to make a change at a later date and have them work properly.
OK to ask questions! If it wasn't because of some of my classmates ( Katie, Ben M., James, Jen, Kathryn, Lauren, Christina, Julie, Alex, Ben L.) I would be lost.
How not to stress: If I was stuck for a long time, I would continue to work on another issue to be stuck in :p, so it's OK to move on with life! -Almost forgot: MODALS! Solution: spending 4-5 hrs on it.
User Stories

User to want a "log in" and "sign up" buttons.
User to want an "alarm" or reminder sound to go back to the game and make
the next move.
User to want a "save game" option to look back at those matches.
User to want a "re-match" and "??? WINS!" buttons.
User to want to be identified as "Player A" or "Player B".
Unsolved Problems:

Didn't get to even try my sound features to let know each player it was their turn.
I wanted to add more "old-school" styling features such as the welcome screen of the original Prince of Persia game and images to pop up when you win. Will go back and revisit.
